# Lung Cancer Prediction

## Overview :
Lung Cancer Prediction is a machine learning application designed to predict the presence of lung cancer using clinical features. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset from Kaggle, this application leverages the Random Forest model to provide predictions with high accuracy, aiming to assist in early diagnosis and treatment planning

## Features :
- **Model :** Utilizes the Random Forest model for predicting the likelihood of lung cancer presence
- **Interactive UI :** Built with Streamlit, providing a user-friendly interface for inputting clinical features and receiving predictions

## Installation :
Follow these steps to set up and run the application locally:

1. Clone the repository :
`git clone https://github.com/GreenGlasses16/lung-cancer-prediction.git`

2. Navigate to the project directory :
`cd lung-cancer-prediction`

3. Install the necessary dependencies :
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

4. Run the Streamlit application :
`streamlit run App.py`

## Usage :
After starting the application, open `http://localhost:8501` in your web browser. Enter the required clinical features through the provided form and submit to get a prediction on lung cancer presence

## Dataset :
The training dataset is sourced from Kaggle and can be found at [Lung Cancer Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mysarahmadbhat/lung-cancer)

## Contributing :
Contributions are welcome to enhance the application's features and performance. Please fork the repository and open a pull request with your changes
